# What is DesireCore

**DesireCore** is a Delegation OS — a cross-platform desktop application that gives you AI companions that can **learn, act, be audited, and be rolled back**.

Unlike traditional "you ask, I answer" chatbots, DesireCore's core philosophy is:

> **I teach you → You plan → You execute → You report → You evolve**

## Core Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Learns** | Captures your preferences and habits through conversation, forming persistent memory |
| **Acts** | Not just chat — executes real tasks and reports results |
| **Auditable** | Every action has a complete record: what was done and why |
| **Reversible** | Roll back any operation at any time, no fear of mistakes |
