# Terms of Service

Last updated: February 7, 2026

## 1. Scope of Service

DesireCore is a delegated-interaction Agent operating system designed to provide users with secure, private, and efficient AI assistant services. Through this software, users can create, manage, and interact with personalized AI assistants.

We are committed to protecting the integrity and privacy of user data. All user data is stored locally on the device by default, unless the user explicitly chooses synchronization or backup services.

## 2. License Agreement

DesireCore v10 and higher versions adopt a tiered licensing model. The core system follows an open-source license, allowing users to freely use, modify, and distribute. Specific feature modules may be subject to additional licensing terms.

Users are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable personal use license. Without written permission, the software may not be used for commercial redistribution or provided as a service to third parties.

## 3. User Responsibilities

Users should properly safeguard their account information and access credentials. We are not responsible for unauthorized access or data leakage caused by user negligence.

Users commit not to use this software for any illegal activities, including but not limited to: generating harmful content, infringing on others' intellectual property rights, or interfering with or disrupting normal service operation.

Users are fully responsible for all content they create and distribute. Content generated by AI assistants is for reference only and does not constitute professional advice.

## 4. Intellectual Property

The DesireCore name, logo, interface design, and software architecture are protected by copyright and trademark laws. Without explicit authorization, copying, modifying, or creating derivative works is prohibited.

Copyright for content generated by users using this service belongs to the users. Users grant us the necessary licenses so that we can provide services and technical support.

## 5. Disclaimer

This software is provided "as is" without any express or implied warranties. We do not guarantee that the service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free.

We are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages resulting from the use or inability to use this service, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

Content generated by AI assistants may contain errors or inaccuracies. Users should independently verify important information, and we assume no responsibility for any consequences arising from reliance on AI-generated content.

## 6. Agreement Changes

We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. Material changes will be communicated to users via in-app notifications or email.

Continued use of the service after changes to the terms constitutes acceptance of the modified terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you should discontinue use of the service and delete your data.

## 7. Termination

Users may discontinue use of the service and delete their data at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate user access in case of violations of these terms.

After service termination, user data will be handled according to our data retention policy. Users may export their data before termination.

## 8. Governing Law

This agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the People's Republic of China. Any disputes arising from this agreement shall first be resolved through friendly consultation; if consultation fails, the dispute shall be submitted to a competent people's court for litigation.
